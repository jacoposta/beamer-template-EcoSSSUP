# beamer-template-EcoSSSUP

This repository provides a `LaTeX` template for the `beamer` 'documentclass' adequately consistent with the **Institute of Economics - Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna** official graphical design.

Customisation is purposefully introduced in terms of style *macros*, rather than as a standalone *theme* to preserve the
greatest deal of flexibility on the user side.

## Usage
 1. modify the provided `EcoSSSUP-template.tex` file as needed (or alternatively, copy the specific file macros (highlighted) into your own *preamble*)
 2. enclose the following files within the same directory
  >* `ecosssup_logo.pdf`
  >* `school_watermark.pdf`
  >* `school_wwhite.pdf`
 3. compile with your favourite `LaTeX` engine.
